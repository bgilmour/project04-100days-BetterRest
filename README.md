# Project 4 (BetterRest)

This is my solution to the BetterRest project (project 4) in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). It includes a small differences to the example code presented in the tutorial, mostly due to my liking for using computed properties to split up the elements of my content view which, in my opinion, makes it easier to follow what's going on.
